# V1 contract test inventory

This inventory maps the compatibility policy to focused tests already present in
the suite. Tests tagged `contract: :public_api` protect the stable facade and
value contracts. Tests tagged `contract: :provider_extension` protect the
third-party provider boundary.

Run the focused suites with:

```sh
mix test --only "contract:public_api"
mix test --only "contract:provider_extension"
mix test --only "host_contract:true"
```

## Stable public contracts

| Contract | Primary evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Model strings, tuples, plain maps, and `%LLMDB.Model{}` values | `test/req_llm_test.exs`, `test/req_llm/model_operation_test.exs` |
| Text generation, streaming, and structured output tuples and bang helpers | `test/req_llm/generation_test.exs` |
| Embedding, image, transcription, speech, reranking, and OCR facades | Corresponding operation tests under `test/req_llm/` |
| Public errors and directly documented key/configuration behavior | `test/req_llm/error_test.exs`, `test/req_llm/keys_test.exs`, `test/req_llm/auth_test.exs` |
| Context, message, content part, tool, tool call, tool result, response, stream response, and stream chunk values | Corresponding value tests under `test/req_llm/` |
| Stream enumeration, metadata, materialization, cancellation, and cleanup | `test/req_llm/stream_response_test.exs` and `test/req_llm/response/stream_test.exs` |
| Deprecated streaming bang helpers and their warnings | `test/req_llm_test.exs`, `test/req_llm/generation_test.exs` |
| One-call host integration across buffered, materialized stream, event, tool-inspection, and continuation paths | `test/contracts/host_integration_contract_test.exs` |

The host integration contract uses representative OpenAI and Anthropic data to
verify that host control flow can remain on canonical public values. Provider
modules only construct the representative responses and stream chunks; the
host-facing projections do not depend on provider modules or wire keys.

## Stable provider extension contracts

`test/contracts/provider_extension_contract_test.exs` applies the reusable
`ReqLLM.ProviderCase.provider_contract/1` checks to a provider defined outside
the first-party provider namespace. It protects required callbacks,
registration, inline model routing, generated identity and schema helpers, and
the callbacks inherited from `ReqLLM.Provider.Defaults`. A minimal provider
fixture verifies that optional callbacks remain optional.

Existing provider defaults and first-party implementations remain covered by
`test/req_llm/provider/defaults_test.exs`, `test/req_llm/providers_test.exs`, and
the provider tests under `test/providers/`. Live model matrices and recorded
provider responses remain compatibility evidence, but are not duplicated by
this contract suite.

## Intentionally not frozen by this suite

- `ReqLLM.OpenAI.Realtime` is explicitly experimental. Its raw session and
  event shapes are not promoted to stable V1 contracts here. Its additive
  projected view reuses stable `ReqLLM.StreamEvent` values only for exact
  overlap while preserving provider-native events separately.
- Venice search-result stream chunks enabled by its explicitly experimental
  provider option are not promoted to stable V1 stream semantics here.
- Private modules, intermediate request maps, and first-party module layout are
  internal implementation details.
- Agent loops, approvals, memory, and workflow orchestration belong to Jido or
  another host and are not ReqLLM API contracts.
